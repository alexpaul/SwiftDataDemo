# SwiftDataDemo

WWDC23 introduces a new persistence API called SwiftData. 

## Glossary 

* `.modelContainer(for: Item.self)`: sets the model container in the scene 
* `SwiftData`: enables you to add persistence to your app quickly, with minimal code and no external dependencies
* `@Model`: converts a Swift class into a stored model thatâ€™s managed by SwiftData
* `@Query private var items: [Item]`: a property wrapper that fetches a set of models and keeps those models in sync with the underlying data
* `@Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext`: the `SwiftData` model context
